                                                <h4>Do Not Track Policy</h4>
                                                <p>California law requires that operators of websites and online
                                                        services disclose how they
                                                        respond to a Do Not Track signal and whether other third parties
                                                        may collect personally
                                                        identifiable information about an individual’s online activities
                                                        from their site or service.
                                                        Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of
                                                        these features, when turned
                                                        on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service
                                                        that a user visits,
                                                        indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. Because
                                                        there is not yet a common
                                                        understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, the
                                                        Service does not currently
                                                        respond to Do Not Track signals. We continue to work with the
                                                        online industry to define a
                                                        common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals.</p>
